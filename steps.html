        <p class="lead">In this example we will take a look at a custom request that was made around Huntsville, Alabama.  Let's
          use the my custom request and create a website to share some findings with field staff and non-technical staff.
          <br>
          Here is an example of what you could do... and host it on github!

          In this example we will take a look at a custom request that was made around Huntsville, Alabama.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Create the HTML page
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          add JavaScript files
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          add Style Sheets
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          add Fonts?
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          add data.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          add branch - add wms layers
          edit code change the wms layer to use the AOI_ID of the custom request.
          You can  get the AOI_ID from the email sent in your custom request.
          The aoi_id is the number after the user name in the zip file that was sent.  Or
          you can get the aoi_id from the custom request - (ADD url to status page).
          Close the branch and send Pull Request.
          merge and delete.
          Lets view the changes and the wms service
        </p>

        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>
          add branch - add tms layers
          Edit the code again this time add the TMS layers.
          look around can you see change?
        </p>


        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>
          Since we already have change maybe we can automate this a bit.
          add branch - navigate change
          lets look at some change data for this Custom Request.
          I have already processed change data using the processdata.sh script.  This
          script did some gdal/ogr work to process imagery, make, tiles for the tms and
          creaeted some basic change data.
          copy this code to the html page so we can navigate throught the change
        </p>

        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>
          Pretty sweet.  so next Lets say we want to see the value of the raster where you click.
          add branch add-click-for-values

          add code
        </p>

        <h3>Step 10</h3>
        <p>
          Thats a lot of change!
          lets limit what we see so we can do not have to see every small change..

          add branch - fix-limit-change

          add code

        </p>

        <h3>Step 11</h3>
        <p>
          Cool some interesting change wonder when it started. looks like a...
          tornodo...
          lets see try and see how the forest recovered...
          luckily I already processed some Customr requests for 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and
          4 years after the event

          add branch - animte change

          add code and add wms layers

        </p>

        <h3>Wrap up</h3>
        <p>
          so a fully functioning app. Housed on Github.  Using Landsat Fact data and servers.
